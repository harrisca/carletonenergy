Status:
Our project gets data from Lucid and Carleton’s weather to provide updates on load and when synced. Historical data can be graphed via the historical tab and there are a series of user preferences that can be used to further enhance the consumer’s experience. Overall the app is in a very lightweight and usable format. Due to out of memory errors



“Getting Started” Guidance:

Our final app is in the “CarletonEnergyApp” directory. It should run as a normal android app.

Most of our testing was on a Google Nexus 5, so ideally we would like to run it on that for the demo.
