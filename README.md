Our project gets data from Lucid and Carleton’s weather to provide updates on load and when synced. Historical energy data can be graphed via the historical tab and there are a series of user preferences that can be used to further enhance the consumer’s experience. Overall the app is in a very lightweight and usable format. Due to out of memory errors the overall UI was scaled back by removing some background elements and removal of the planned animation. While the current app is perfectly functional it could be expanded in several directions all which have also have solid framework in the code but could not be implemented due to time constraints. Examples of this include changing to using a Provider for data syncing and to replace the shared prefs. 





“Getting Started” Guidance:

Our final app is in the “CarletonEnergyApp” directory. It should run as a normal android app.

Most of our testing was on a Google Nexus 5, so ideally we would like to run it on that for the demo.
