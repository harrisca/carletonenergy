##Description

Our project gets data from Lucid and Carleton’s weather to provide updates on load and when synced. Historical energy data can be graphed via the historical tab and there are a series of user preferences that can be used to further enhance the consumer’s experience. 

##Status

Overall the app is in a very lightweight and usable format, with all of our core features implemented. Due to out of memory errors the overall UI was scaled back by removing some background elements and the planned animation.  Our app could be expanded in several directions all which have also have solid framework in the code but could not be implemented due to time constraints. For example, we also wanted to implement background alerts while the app is inactive, but were only able to make alerts and syncing work with the app open.


##“Getting Started” Guidance:

Our final app is in the “CarletonEnergyApp” directory. It should run as a normal android app.

Most of our testing was on a Google Nexus 5, so ideally we would like to run it on that for the demo.
